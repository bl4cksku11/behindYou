Bl4cksku11 OSINT tool

## Description
I have made this tool to do OSINT, it is very useful to do some recognition tasks, directly using the Shodan API, I will be adding more recognition functionalities to the tool over time, I hope you enjoy it and get the best out of it.

### Important!!!!
At line 44 you must change the API_Key
Note: the key must be premium. You can find one doing googling or also making a brute force, it is easy.
```bash
shodan_api_key = 'PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
```

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bl4cksku11/behindYou.git
cd behindYou
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 behindYou.py
```
